## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at [UNC Charlotte](https://www.charlotte.edu/), where I am fortunate to be supervised
by [Prof. Wenhao Luo](https://webpages.charlotte.edu/wluo4/). I completed my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering
from [DUT](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), and prior to that, I obtained my bachelor’s
degree from [UPC](https://english.upc.edu.cn/). I am passionate about Robotics, Control theory, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning, and my goal is to empower robots with intelligence, enabling them to make informed decisions and interact seamlessly with the world. 
<!--- Specifically, my research focuses on principled methods for robust and interactive autonomy that enable robots to safely and effectively collaborate with each other and with humans in the physical world. -->


<!--- My research interests include Robotics, Control, Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning.  My current research focuses on applying deep learning models to anomaly detection and automated batch job schedulers. -->
